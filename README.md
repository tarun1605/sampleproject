# SAS API Automation Test

In this exercise, you will have 3 hours to create tests and supporting functions in Java to test certain user journeys through GitHub using its API. 

Write three tests to verify the following user journeys;

1.	As a user, I want to be able to login, see my details, and get a list of my repositories
2.	As a user, I want to be able to create, edit and view a repository
3.	As a user, I want to be able to create an Issue, get a list of Issues for my repo, and add / view comments on that Issue.

Your code should be written to maximise its maintainability and reusability.

Refer to the GitHub API v3 documentation for information: https://developer.github.com/v3/ 

GitHub model classes may be imported, if desired, from;
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.kohsuke/github-api

You will need to choose a test framework / mechanism by which you make API requests.
